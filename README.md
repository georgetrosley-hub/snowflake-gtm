# Snowflake GTM Command Center

Internal GTM hub for Snowflake Account Executives. This project provides a single place for platform narrative, deal playbooks, field kit, and war room tools — designed to feel at home on **snowflake.com** for every internal GTM AE.

## What’s inside

- **Platform Overview** — AI Data Cloud pillars, key metrics, and strategic message
- **Why Snowflake, Why Now** — Strategic transition, timeline highlights, buyer expansion
- **War Room** — Account-centric view (accounts N/A until configured)
- **Account Intelligence, Pipeline, Deal Playbook, Deal Progression, Account Log**
- **Stakeholder Map, Deal Plan**
- **First 90 Days, Deal Signals, Field Kit**
- **Use Case Library, ROI Calculator, Territory Engine**
- **Platform vs Alternatives** — Snowflake vs Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift

Content is aligned with Snowflake’s position as the **governed operating system for enterprise AI**: Cortex, Snowflake Intelligence, Cortex Code, MCP, Snowflake Postgres, Horizon, and Observe.

## Accounts
